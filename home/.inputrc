# bell-style (audible)
#   Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal
#   bell. If set to none, readline never rings the bell. If set to
#   visible, readline uses a visible bell if one is available. If set
#   to audible, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
set bell-style none

# completion-ignore-case (Off)
#   If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion
#   in a case-insensitive fashion.
set completion-ignore-case on

# completion-query-items (100)
#   This determines when the user is queried about viewing the number
#   of possible completions generated by the possible-comple-tions
#   command. It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal
#   to zero. If the number of possible completions is greater than or
#   equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether or
#   not he wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed on
#   the terminal.
set completion-query-items 32

# convert-meta (On)
#   If set to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit
#   set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and
#   prefixing an escape character (in effect, using escape as the meta
#   prefix).
set convert-meta off

# input-meta (Off)
#   If set to On, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it
#   will not strip the high bit from the characters it reads),
#   regardless of what the terminal claims it can support. The name
#   meta-flag is a synonym for this variable.
set input-meta on

# mark-directories (On)
#   If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.
set mark-directories on

# output-meta (Off)
#   If set to On, readline will display characters with the eighth bit
#   set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
set output-meta on

# print-completions-horizontally (Off)
#   If set to On, readline will display completions with matches
#   sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the
#   screen.
set print-completions-horizontally on

# copy-region-as-kill (C-w)
# "\C-v": paste-from-clipboard
